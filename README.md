# hello-world

I am currently learning how to code! As much as I like learning, I do like the challenges and practicing what I learned, analysing and solving problems, and sharing with the great minds withing great community. Hope what I am learning can contrubute in creating a better world! I am especially interested in the various ways tech can be used to improving fashion supply chain, so creating better living conditions for the people involved in. I do believe we have enough of everything and now we need to solve on what we have!
