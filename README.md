# Hello-World! Who is Sevda?

I am currently self-teaching myself how to code! As much as I like learning and evolving, I do like the challenges, analysing and solving problems. Proud to be a part of these great community based on sharing values. Hope what I am learning can contrubute in creating a better world! I am especially interested in the various ways tech can be used to improving fashion supply chain, and reduce physical production so creating better living conditions for the people involved in. I do believe we have enough of everything and now we need to solve on what we have! 

xx, Sevda

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning modern HTML, CSS & JavaScript methodologies.
âš¡ Fun fact: My first attempt to tech was when I have started learning UX/UI. Then; HTML, CSS & JavaScript ++ languages followed that journey.
